        <h3>The situation around the world</h3>
        <p>At the moment, recent efforts around the world have hit obstacles in bringing more education in rural communities. While males are usually supported in their efforts to seek higher education for girls in these communities are frequently not given the same opportunities and support in this endeavor. In these communities, limited finances have pushed them to only send their best men to urban centers for further education.</p>
        <h3>Current Times</h3>
        <p>As such, we sought to think about a potential solution or at least an avenue for these girls to attain more education. Thus, we came up with the idea of a simple website that can help rural communities set up virtual and onsite education centers tailored to these young girls.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to assist rural communities in educating their young girls by allowing them to gain more knowledge and skills in a safe, virtual environment to catch up to their male peers. It seeks to create virtual classrooms for teachers and students under the watch of educational organizations to reach educational standards and provide resources for these students for further education and additional career paths.</p>
